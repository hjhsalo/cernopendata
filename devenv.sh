# 1. Check what needs to be installed. From a file and from ENV_VAR.
# Make one single list and check for duplicates.

# 3. Start cloning git repos.
# TODO: Find if it is possible to force overwrite / clone with git or should
# existing folders first be deleted.

# 4. Generate a requirements.txt for installation of development modules.
